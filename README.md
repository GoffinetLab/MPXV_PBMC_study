# ABSTRACT

Mpox virus (MPXV), formerly known as monkeypox virus, led to a rapidly evolving pandemic starting May 2022, with over 90.000 cases reported beyond the African continent. This pandemic outbreak was driven by the MPXV variant Clade IIb. In addition, Clade I viruses circulating in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are drawing increased attention as cases constantly rise and Clade Ib, first identified in 2023, is now co-circulating with Clade Ia and seems to exhibits enhanced human-to-human transmissibility (Vakaniaki et al. 2024). While most infected individuals display a self-limiting disease with singular pox-like lesions, some endure systemic viral spread leading to whole-body rash with risks for necrosis, organ loss, and death. Intra-host dissemination and cellular tropism of MPXV are largely unexplored in humans. To establish a potential susceptibility of circulating immune cells to MPXV, we exposed human PBMCs from healthy donors ex vivo to a currently circulating MPXV clade IIb virus isolate in absence and presence of Interferon-α2a. qRT-PCR of DNA extracted from cell lysates, but less from ? not supernatants, revealed increasing MPXV DNA  quantities that peaked at five to six days post-exposure, suggesting susceptibility of PBMCs to infection. IFN-α2a pretreatment markedly reduced the quantity of MPXV DNA, suggesting that infection is sensitive to type I IFNs. Plaque assays from supernatants showed that infection gave rise to de novo production of infectious MPXV. In virus-inclusive scRNA-sequencing, monocytes, cycling NK cells and regulatory CD4+ T-cells scored positive for viral RNA, suggesting that these are the MPXV-susceptible cell types within the human PBMC population. Analysis of differentially expressed genes displayed a pronounced downregulation of expression pathways driving innate immunity  in MPXV-infected cells, a well-established feature of poxviral infection. Pretreatment of PBMCs with current antivirals Cidofovir and Tecovirimat resulted in reduced MPXV DNA quantities and released infectivity, suggesting suitability of the human PBMC infection model as a platform for evaluation of current and future antivirals and justifying trials to investigate t Cidofovir and Tecovirimat as drugs reducing intra-patient viral spread. Together, our data suggest that human PBMCs are productively infected by MPXV which is accompanied by significant modulation of the cellular milieu. Our results have the potential to illuminate aspects of intra-host propagation of MPXV that may involve a lymphohaematogenous route for replication and/or in-host dissemination.
